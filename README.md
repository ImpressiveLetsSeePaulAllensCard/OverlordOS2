# OverlordOS

The choice of the GNU GPL 3.0 license for our project was made considering the goal of ensuring software freedom, among other advantages. However, users and contributors should be aware of its obligations to ensure compliance and to make informed decisions about its use.

The widespread adoption of the GNU GPL is appealing to us because it is very well known and used by many making it easy for new team members to get started quickly with very little overhead.

Because of the nature of this project, we are not concerned with any tivoization concerns, because this product will never be bought or sold.
