# Licensing: GNU GPL 3.0

The choice of the **GNU GPL 3.0** license for our project was made considering the goal of ensuring software freedom, among other advantages. However, users and contributors should be aware of its obligations to ensure compliance and to make informed decisions about its use.

## Why We Chose GNU GPL 3.0

- **Widespread Adoption**: The widespread adoption of the GNU GPL is appealing to us because it is very well known and used by many. This makes it easy for new team members to get started quickly with very little overhead.
  
- **No Concerns About Tivoization**: Due to the nature of this project, we are not concerned with any tivoization concerns. This product will never be bought or sold.
